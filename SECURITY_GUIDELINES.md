# AIOS Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security practices and recommendations for the AIOS (AI Orchestration System) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system and its data.

## 1. API Key Management

The AIOS uses API keys for authentication and access control. The `APIKeyManager` handles the generation, validation, revocation, and rotation of API keys.

### 1.1 Best Practices for API Key Usage:

*   **Treat API Keys as Sensitive Information:** API keys grant access to your AIOS resources. Treat them with the same level of security as passwords.
*   **Avoid Hardcoding:** Do not hardcode API keys directly into your application's source code. Use environment variables, configuration files, or a secure secrets management system.
*   **Least Privilege:** Grant API keys only the necessary permissions required for their intended function. Avoid using a single API key for all operations.
*   **Regular Rotation:** Implement a regular rotation policy for API keys. The `rotate_api_key` function can be used for this purpose.
*   **Immediate Revocation:** If an API key is compromised or no longer needed, immediately revoke it using the `revoke_api_key` function.
*   **Secure Storage:** Store API keys securely on your servers. Avoid storing them in client-side code or publicly accessible repositories.
*   **Monitor Usage:** Monitor API key usage for any unusual activity that might indicate compromise.

### 1.2 API Key Lifecycle:

*   **Generation:** API keys are generated using `generate_api_key` with a specified `user_id` and `expires_in_days`.
*   **Validation:** API keys are validated using `validate_api_key`, which checks for existence, activity status, and expiration.
*   **Revocation:** API keys can be deactivated using `revoke_api_key`.
*   **Rotation:** Existing API keys can be rotated to new ones using `rotate_api_key`.

## 2. Authentication (JWT)

The AIOS uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication, primarily for user and internal service authentication.

### 2.1 Best Practices for JWT Usage:

*   **Secure Secret Key:** The `SECRET_KEY` used for signing JWTs (`config.security.jwt_secret` or `JWT_SECRET` environment variable) must be strong, unique, and kept confidential. Never expose this key.
*   **Short Expiration Times:** Access tokens should have short expiration times (`ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`). This limits the window of opportunity for attackers if a token is compromised.
*   **Refresh Tokens (Optional but Recommended):** For longer sessions, consider implementing refresh tokens. Refresh tokens should have longer expiration times and be stored securely (e.g., in an HTTP-only cookie or secure database).
*   **HTTPS Only:** Always transmit JWTs over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Token Invalidation:** Implement mechanisms to invalidate tokens if a user logs out or their credentials are compromised. While JWTs are stateless, a blacklist or revocation list can be used.
*   **Payload Security:** Do not include sensitive information directly in the JWT payload, as it is only encoded, not encrypted. Only include necessary claims like `user_id` or `username`.
*   **Algorithm:** Use strong signing algorithms like `HS256` (HMAC with SHA-256) or stronger asymmetric algorithms like `RS256`.

### 2.2 Authentication Flow:

*   **Token Creation:** `create_access_token` generates a JWT with user data and an expiration time.
*   **Password Hashing:** Passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt` via `get_password_hash` and verified with `verify_password`.
*   **User Authentication:** `get_current_user` and `get_current_active_user` functions handle token validation and user retrieval based on the JWT.

## 3. Password Security

Passwords are a critical component of user authentication.

### 3.1 Best Practices for Password Management:

*   **Strong Hashing:** Use a strong, modern hashing algorithm like `bcrypt` (as implemented with `CryptContext`) for storing passwords. Never store plain-text passwords.
*   **Salting:** `bcrypt` automatically handles salting, which protects against rainbow table attacks.
*   **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for users (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements, disallowing common passwords).
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.

## 4. General Security Recommendations

*   **Input Validation:** Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, command injection, XSS).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling that does not expose sensitive system information in error messages.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging for security-related events (e.g., failed login attempts, API key usage, system errors). Regularly monitor these logs for suspicious activity.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly update all third-party libraries and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools to scan for vulnerable dependencies.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that all components, services, and users operate with the minimum necessary permissions.
*   **Secure Configuration:** Review and secure all system configurations, including network settings, database configurations, and application settings.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability assessments.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest (e.g., database encryption) and in transit (e.g., HTTPS for all communications).
*   **Backup and Recovery:** Implement a secure backup and recovery strategy to ensure data availability and integrity in case of a security incident.

## 5. Environment Variables and Configuration

Sensitive configuration details should be managed securely.

*   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables for sensitive information like `JWT_SECRET` and database credentials. Avoid committing these to version control.
*   **Configuration Management:** The `ConfigManager` loads configuration. Ensure that configuration files containing sensitive data are properly secured with appropriate file permissions.

By adhering to these guidelines, we can significantly enhance the security posture of the AIOS.
